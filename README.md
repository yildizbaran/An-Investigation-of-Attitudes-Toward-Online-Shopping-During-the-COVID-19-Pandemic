Investigation of Attitudes Toward Online Shopping During the COVID-19 Pandemic
This repository contains the work from my undergraduate thesis, which explores the attitudes toward online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic. The thesis primarily uses SPSS for data analysis to investigate various factors, such as perceived ease of use, trust, perceived usefulness, and the overall impact of COVID-19 on online shopping behaviors. The study aims to uncover key insights into how the pandemic has influenced consumer behavior in the context of e-commerce.
